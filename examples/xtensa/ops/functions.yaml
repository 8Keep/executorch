# This yaml file contains operators that are also defined by the ATen library.
# For lean mode:
#   - Codegen'd target `executorch_generated_lib` will be reading all the information
#     from this file, including operator schema and kernel metadata.
#   - Selective build target `codegen:executorch_defined_ops` now is selecting all the
#     operators in this file, by dumping all the op names into `selected_operators.yaml`.
#
# See the README.md file in executorch/kernels/portable for a description of the syntax used
# by this file.
